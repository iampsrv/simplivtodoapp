# Flask To-Do Application

A simple to-do list application built with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Delete tasks from your to-do list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-todo-app.git
   cd flask-todo-app


Replace the placeholders (`yourusername`, `YourGitHubUsername`, `YourLinkedInProfile`, etc.) with your actual information. You can also include additional sections, such as a "Deployment" section if you've deployed the application online or a "Troubleshooting" section if there are common issues users might encounter.

Don't forget to include a screenshot or demo GIF of your application to give users a visual preview of what it looks like. Save the screenshot as `screenshot.png` in your project directory.

After creating your README file, commit it to your GitHub repository along with your code. Users visiting your repository will now have clear instructions on how to set up and use your Flask to-do application.
